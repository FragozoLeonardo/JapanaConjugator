# KatsuYOU (活ヨウ), a Japanese language Conjugator CLI

This is a small command-line interface (CLI) tool for generating inflections of verbs, adjectives and names in the Japanese language.

Please note that it does not cover all variations since Japanese is an agglutinative language with nearly infinite possibilities. However, it aims to cover the most common ones.

Verbs are more complex, so their functionality will be released gradually. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Usage

To use this CLI tool, ensure that Ruby is installed on your machine. You can download Ruby [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

Once Ruby is installed, navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repository and execute the following command:

ruby conjugator.rb

## TODO List:

- Add support for irregular verbs. - Including less know conjunctive/ta irregulars such as 問う, 乞う/請う　and honorific language (keigo) irregulars such as 下さる/いらっしゃる.
- Add a built-in "guide" explaining how to get the best from this tool with some Japanese language related advice usually not taught by non-native textbooks.
- Make improvements to the menu usability.
- Add Rspec specs for saving time on content proofreading and functionalities.
- Improve the file structure in order to feel more oop-esque.

Please enjoy using the CLI! <3
