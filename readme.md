# Japanese Conjugator CLI

This is a small command-line interface (CLI) tool for generating inflections of adjectives and names in the Japanese language.

Please note that it does not cover all variations since Japanese is an agglutinative language with nearly infinite possibilities. However, it aims to cover the most common ones.

Verbs are more complex, so their functionality will be released gradually. Your understanding is appreciated.

## Usage

To use this CLI tool, ensure that Ruby is installed on your machine. You can download Ruby [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

Once Ruby is installed, navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repository and execute the following command:

ruby conjugator.rbg
