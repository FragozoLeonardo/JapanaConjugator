# KatsuYOU (活ユー), a Japanese language Conjugator CLI

This is a small command-line interface (CLI) tool for generating inflections of verbs, adjectives and names in the Japanese language.

Please note that it does not cover all variations since Japanese is an agglutinative language with nearly infinite possibilities. However, it aims to cover the most common ones.

## Usage

To use this CLI tool, ensure that Ruby is installed on your machine. You can download Ruby [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org).

Once Ruby is installed, navigate to the folder where you have cloned this repository and execute the following command:

ruby conjugator.rb
## Sample Images
WIP
## TODO List:

- Add Rspec specs for content proofreading based on native resources and CLI functionalities. (Once I get better on Rspec.)
- Take propper screenshots for the readme
- "Deploy" the CLI at repl.it

Please enjoy using the CLI! <3
